This is a readme for the figures that have been uploaded. 

error.png:
  graph of the misclassifications, averaged over all of the detectors, for each energy
  these are based on the discrimLine with shift
  misclassification is for a bin size of .2 with a minE of .4 and a maxE of 6
    gotten by runing psdMisclassification

densityPlot.png
  histogram of PSD by Intergal with density coloring. 
    gotten by running psdAnalysis.py, densityPlots

slice_x_y.png
  examples of plots of a histogramed section of data from detector x and energy y 
  this plot has the gaussian curves and the shifted discrimination line
  these plots all have bin sizes of .2 with a minE of .4 and a maxE of 6
